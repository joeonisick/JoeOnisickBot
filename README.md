# JoeOnisickBot
This non-innovative and non-intuitive project replaces the real life Joe Onisick with somethig far more useful. Namely a Twitter bot with minimal functionality. The application interfaces with users through its Twitter account @JoeOnisickBot. The bot is designed to engage with users and provide a Joe Onisick experience that, unlike the real version, is based on logic. In this case logic in the form of Python code written by someone with no idea what they're doing.

## Prerequisites

- Python3.5 and above
- In your Python virtual environment terminal type `python -v` to check your version.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you moving with your own low-function (unlike low-code) Twitter Bot.
- Sign up for a Twitter devleoper acocunt. Your inital Essential access will work for this project. https://developer.twitter.com/
- Clone this repository using `git clone https://github.com/joeonisick/JoeOnisickBot.git`
- Install Tweepy `pip install tweepy`
- Tweepy Install Documentation: https://docs.tweepy.org/en/stable/install.html
- Tweepy Getting Started Documentation: https://docs.tweepy.org/en/stable/getting_started.html
- Tweepy Note: Tweepy's documentaiton is a dumpster fire, and their object use isn't very intuitive.
- Tweepy Note: When searching for Tweepy help pay close attention Twitter is between API versions so many answers don't work.
- Switch to the project directory: `cd JoeOnisickBot`
- I have not yet created a requirements doc, so you're on your own from here.

To use the project you will need the following files:
- App.py: Contains the main program functions. This is the file you will run to start the bot.
- Support_Functions.py: This file contains functions used by the program, as well as some functions for maintenance and support.
  - General functions like send_tweet live here and are called by App.py. Other functions like commit_and_tweet can be used here as desired.
- photo_query.txt:  used to store the query string for photo requests to pass to Twitter. A text file is used to ensure accurate string passing.
- photo_since.txt:  stores latest tweet id of the last photo replied to. Stored to text to save across program runs. Will be created by the app.
- since_id: stored latest tweet id of the last mention followed. Stored to text to save across program runs. Will be created by the app.
- secrets.py: ENSURE THIS IS IN YOUR .gitignore. This declares API keys and file locations returning them from a function.
- Example_Secrets: Example Secrets files with placeholders for your keys and directories. Rename and add to .gitignore before adding keys.

## Built With

- Tweepy
- Twitter API V1 & V2 (object dependant). Currently this project will fully function with a Twitter Developer Essential account.

## Contributing

Contirubtions to this project are welcome. Be warned in advance that the project owner is clueless as to how to manage a project. If you'd like to contribute you may have to coach him through the process. By coach I mean, treat him like a very dumb child.

## Versioning

Currently there is only one version. As soon as the author figures out versioning best practices this will be updated.

## License

Pending some research.

## Future Plans

This app will be containerized and designed to run cloud native using cloud storage buckets.
