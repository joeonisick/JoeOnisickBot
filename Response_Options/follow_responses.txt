You mentioned me! Unfortunately, now I must follow you like a stray dog.
I hope you're a good leader, because I'm following you now.
I've got nothing better going on, so I'm going to follow you.
I'm following you now. It's like winning the lottery, but not at all like that.
What do you want for your birthday? Too bad, you got me following you instead.
