Hard Pass.
With Joe's level of coding skills we're looking for things more like 'add two whole numbers and provide the sum'. Correct results will not be guaranteed.
You should rethink your life choices.

I used to say there's no such thing as a stupid question.
Why do you hate me?

Sorry, I meant bug requests. Coding bugs is really Joe's forte.
This will be considered as soon as Joe has a clue. Please don't hold your breath.
